    <h1>Resources</h1>
    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>A collection resources I've used throughout the years:</p>

    <h2>my favorite resources</h2>
    <p>caution: youtube heavy lol</p>

    <h3>Resources for productivity and learning</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><a noreferrer noopener target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@aliabdaal">Ali Abdaal</a></strong>: Ali Abdaal is one my favorite resources to learn new productivity methods, not just for school but life in general. He also recently released a great book called <em>Feel Good Productivity</em> which builds on lessons from his Youtube channel.</li>
        <li><strong><a noreferrer noopener target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/studyquill">Studyquill</a></strong>: great introduction into the science of learning, as well as fun vids about stationary, hobbies, and personal finance for young adults.</li>
        <li><strong><a noreferrer noopener target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@elizabethfilips">Elizabeth Filips</a>: </strong>Great summaries of research on neuroscience, psychology, and productivity. Also interesting neurodivergent perspective with great alternative approaches to popular producitivity methods.</li>
        <li><strong>Pomodoro timers</strong>: At this point in time, there are lots of timers to try out. It doesn't really which one you use, as long you find a time interval that works for you! I personally really enjoy: </li>
        <ul>
            <li>30/5</li>
            <li>50/10</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Favorite internet things</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><a noreferrer noopener target="_blank" href="https://tldr.tech/">TLDR newsletter: </a></strong> one of my favorite tech newsletters to stay up to date, with more focused newsletters available on webdev, ai, infosec, etc</li>
        <li><strong>Notion</strong>: now, I'm not a notion girlie by any means, however it's hard to deny how useful Notion can be. I mainly use it for notetaking and keeping track of assignments. I currenlty use <a noreferrer noopener target="_blank" href="https://play.aliabdaal.com/studying-bundle">this template</a> from Ali Abdaal</li>
        <li>I also really like <a target="_blank" noreffer noopener href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DIrdATUcYI&t=513s">this video</a> by Han Zhago along with the template included in the description box</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>tips for using & finding resources</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>click on anything that interests you</li>
        <li>don't fall into the trap of watching productivty content just to feel productive lol</li>
        <li>Don't be afraid to try new things but also don't get bogged down by all the resources out there. There is no "perfect" resource, but find whats works for you and stick with it. As the age old adage says, "If it ain't broken, don't fix it."</li>
    </ol>
