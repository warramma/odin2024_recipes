        <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>
        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>Learning how to grow and accept mistakes is a pretty big part of being a successful student.</p>
        <p>In the past, I never tried to challenge myself because I was scared of failure. I also tended to see my own abilities as stagnant, which limited my growth. Under a growth mindset, however...</p>
        <h2>What you need:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>figure out what's stopping you: </strong>is it fear of failure? is it expectations of others? is it procrastination? some of everything? Sitting down and reflecting on the reasons why you don't always get thinks done when you want to can help you identify the problem. Asking a trusted friend can also help.</li>
            <li><strong>embrace challenge: </strong> This point was very difficult for me since I was always so focused on outcomes only, especially as an eldest daughter, child of immigrants. I was scared to take on any challenges because I was too pressured by the fact people thought I should be good at everything. it was discouraging when I wasn't immediately good at something. However, challenge is how we grow.</li>
            <li><strong>embrace mistakes: </strong> with challenges and new experiences come new mistakes. It's okay to feel embarrassed, but remember to take mistakes in stride. Once you acknowledge mistakes, you're able to learn from them and continue to improve.</li>
            <li><strong>Ditch "it's too hard": </strong> Ofc, we're all talented in our own ways, however, don't just write things off because they're hard for you right now. getting to the bottom of why things are difficult and reprogramming yourself to think, "I'll keep trying," instead of "It's too hard," can do wonders.</li>
        </ul>
