    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>
        Active recall is a technique where you push your brain to actively remember information, rather than passively experience it. For example, asking yourself questions or doing practice problems instead of spending an hour highlighting your notes and realizing you remember nothing. When you're engaging in learning actively, you learn more and you learn better; you're creating those connections in your brain and pushing your brain to do the work.
    </p>
    <h2>What you need:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Somewhere to store questions for yourself</strong>. could be a notebook, Word doc, flashcards, Google sheet, etc</li>
        <li><strong>Practice questions</strong>. These could be ones you write yourself, ones given to you, or a mix of both.</li>
        <li><strong>Grit</strong>. If you're just starting out, active recall can feel daunting and difficult. And it is difficult, or at least more difficult than learning something passively. You may feel as though your brain is straining itself. which leads us to...</li>
        <li><strong>To take breaks.</strong> According to Cal Newport, even the best of us can only focus intensely on something for roughly 4 hours a day. Learning is hard work for our brains so make sure to take breaks as needed. In fact, taking breaks will help knowledge sink in faster, due to the learning our brains due in the background. Think back to times you couldn't figure out something then came back a few hours later and something everything made sense.</li>
        <li><strong>Good food and hydration</strong>. I think it goes without saying good food and water intake can help our brains a ton. Whatever you have the means to do, treat yourself well by feeding yourself as well as possible. On that note...</li>
        <li><strong>Sleep!!!</strong> We learn better when we're well rested!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How I use Active Recall:</h2>
    <p>Now, I'm not an expert by any means. If you're looking for those, check out my <a noreferrer noopener href="../odin2024_recipes/resources.html">Resources page</a>. For the sole purpose of sharing experiences and learning from each other, here is my current active recall process:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Understand the assignment</li>
        <li>Open up my medium, whether that be a notebook or a Notion page</li>
        <li>Start reading. Don't jot down any notes yet. Make sure I understand what going on, if not, reread, reread, reread. Sometimes saying it out loud helps.</li>
        <li>After I feel that I've covered an important concept, I take a few seconds to consolidate my thoughts</li>
        <li>I come up with a question that will make me think critically about what I'm reading or help me recall important info. e.g what is the author's main argument about Disney princesses?</li>
        <li>I don't write down the answer to the question just yet</li>
        <li>I repeat steps 3-6 until I've reached the end of the reading material. If the material is very long, then I'd pause after 10 or so pages.</li>
        <li>I circle back and answer my own questions, checking what I remember, referring to the text for what I don't.</li>
        <li>repeat until finished</li>
    </ol>
    <p>And that's my current recipe for active recall!</p>
