    <h1>Recipes for Academic Success</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm Wardiyah and I've been a student since I was 4. As I've gotten older and am currently a college student, I've learned a lot about what it means to learn and learn effectively. This page is just as much for me as it is for any random people out there (I have the memory of a fish when it comes to remembering things about myself). For me, this is a place to reflect and list out things that have worked for me as a student. For you, idk, gentle advice?</p>
